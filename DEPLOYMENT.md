- Added deployment scripts to `package.json`:
  - `"predeploy": "npm run build"`
  - `"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"`
- Installed `gh-pages` package as dev dependency

### 3. Successfully Built and Deployed ✅

- Deployment completed without the previous E2BIG error
- `gh-pages` branch created with built application files
- All static assets properly generated in `/static/` directory

## Troubleshooting

If the React application doesn't load immediately:

1. **Check GitHub Pages Settings**: Ensure the source is set to `gh-pages` branch
2. **Wait for Propagation**: GitHub Pages can take a few minutes to update
3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Force refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Verify Build**: Check that `gh-pages` branch contains `index.html` and `static/` folder

## Next Steps for Further Development

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to actual permit management APIs
2. **Authentication**: Implement real user authentication system
3. **Database**: Replace demo data with actual permit records
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **Accessibility**: Conduct full accessibility audit and improvements
6. **Performance**: Optimize bundle size and loading performance
