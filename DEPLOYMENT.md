# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy your React fishing permit system to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

✅ **Already completed:**
- Installed `gh-pages` package
- Added homepage URL to package.json
- Added deployment scripts to package.json
- Changed from BrowserRouter to HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Successfully built the project

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push your code to GitHub

First, make sure your code is pushed to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Run the deployment command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will:
- Build your React app (`npm run build`)
- Create a `gh-pages` branch in your repository
- Push the built files to the `gh-pages` branch

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/joshua-daniel-lee/$Amoa2025!!!`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Select **gh-pages** branch and **/ (root)** folder
6. Click **Save**

### 4. Access your deployed site

Your site will be available at:
```
https://joshua-daniel-lee.github.io/$Amoa2025!!!
```

**Note:** It may take a few minutes for the site to be available after the first deployment.

## Important Notes

### Router Configuration
- The app uses `HashRouter` instead of `BrowserRouter` for GitHub Pages compatibility
- URLs will have a hash (#) in them (e.g., `yoursite.com/#/permits`)
- This is necessary because GitHub Pages doesn't support client-side routing

### Build Warnings
The build completed with some warnings about unused variables:
- `PermitsPage` component in App.jsx (line 67)
- `PrimaryNav` component in Header.jsx (line 6)

These warnings don't affect functionality but can be cleaned up if desired.

### Future Deployments

For future updates:
1. Make your changes
2. Commit and push to your main branch
3. Run `npm run deploy` again

The `gh-pages` branch will be automatically updated with your new build.

## Troubleshooting

### Site not loading
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the source is set to `gh-pages` branch
- Wait a few minutes as deployment can take time

### Routing issues
- Make sure you're using `HashRouter` (already configured)
- Check that all internal links use React Router's `Link` component

### Build issues
- Run `npm run build` locally first to check for errors
- Fix any build errors before deploying

## Package.json Configuration

Your package.json now includes:

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://joshua-daniel-lee.github.io/$Amoa2025!!!",
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
  }
}
```

## File Structure After Deployment

```
your-repo/
├── main branch (your source code)
└── gh-pages branch (built files for hosting)
    ├── index.html
    ├── static/
    │   ├── css/
    │   └── js/
    └── other built assets
```

The `gh-pages` branch is automatically managed by the deployment script.
